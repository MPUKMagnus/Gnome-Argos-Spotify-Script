# Gnome-Argos-Spotify-Script
This script launches using Argos (Gnome Extension for adding launchers to your menu bar) to show Spotify information and provide some controls.

Pre-requisites:
- wmctrl: `sudo apt-get install wmctrl`
- Argos (https://github.com/p-e-w/argos): `https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1176/argos/`
- Gnome Tweaks

Place the script inside your `~/.config/argos/` and make it excutable `chmod +x spotify.c.2s+.sh` DIR and Argos will pick it up automatically.

You can change the information update frequency by renaming the file, please see Argos documentation: https://github.com/p-e-w/argos#filename-format
